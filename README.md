Sinatra Brokerage App
This Sinatra app allows users to create brokerage accounts and add or delete stocks from their accounts.

Users can view stocks in their accounts to see additional information including the ticker symbol, stock

name, and the number of shares they own. For a user-friendly experience, the account holder can name

their accounts and classify the strategy category as a reminder of the fund's investment goals.

To use this app, simply clone this repository, run 'bundle' and 'rake db:migrate'.

To seed the database with test/example data, run rake db:seed.

This app includes gem 'shotgun'. Run 'shotgun' to view and interact with the site locally.
